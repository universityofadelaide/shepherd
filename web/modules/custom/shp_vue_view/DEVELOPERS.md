# Shepherd Vue.js View Module 

## Installation for Development  

The JavaScript component is built with Vue.js, Webpack and Babel ( for transpiling ES6 syntax ).

- Ensure that you have node and npm installed. 
- `npm install`

Building the compiled javascript:
- `npm run webpack` - Builds the assets for development.
- `npm run dev` - Builds the assets and runs a watch task. This task is for development only as it does no minification or optimisation.
- `npm run production` - Builds the assets for a production environment. Minifys and Optmises the code.
