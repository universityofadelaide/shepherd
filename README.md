Shepherd
========

Shepherd is a web based administration tool for web sites using the 
[OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) Container Platform.

The development environment for Shepherd requires an instance of the Shepherd 
Drupal app running in Docker on your host machine and either:

* [Minishift](https://www.openshift.org/minishift/) virtual machine - which
provides an OpenShift cluster for local development or
* [Openshift](https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md) running in
docker - rather than in a virtual machine. 

The [oc](https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases) command line tool enables
interaction with the OpenShift cluster.
